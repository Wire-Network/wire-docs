# Deploy Hello World Contract on Wire Testnet


## Overview 

This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy a simple `hello-world` smart contract on the Wire Testnet. We’ll create a new contract account, build and deploy the contract, and then invoke its action both from the Wire Hub and via the command line using `clio`.

## Prerequisites

- Before proceeding forward, ensure that **you have completed Getting Started section** and that you have followed [Getting Started Documentation Diagram](/docs/getting-started/getting-started-intro.md).
- This page assumes you are familiar with [Smart Contract Basics](/docs/smart-contract-development/smart-contract-basics).

:::warning[NOTE]
The wallet is configured for the `root` user, so all `clio` commands in this tutorial are prefixed with *sudo*.

## Steps 
### 1. Connect to the Wire Hub & Create Your Wire Testnet Account

- **Open [Wire Hub](https://hub.wire.network)** in your browser.  
- **Connect your wallet** (e.g., MetaMask).  
   - Once connected, the Hub should display your account’s public address.  
- **Create your on-chain account** in the [Wire Testnet Explorer](https://hub.wire.network/explore):  
   - You’ll be prompted to **sign a message** in MetaMask to retrieve your public key.  
   - After signing, the system creates a new user account associated with that public key.


---

### 2. Request a Developer Contract Policy

- **Open the [Node Owner Dashboard](https://hub.wire.network/explore/node-owner)**.  
- **Request `Developer Contract Policy`** for a new contract account:  
   - Randomly generated usernames and keys are displayed. You can shuffle them if you want.  
   - **Save these credentials** in a secure place — this account will be the contract account you will deploy your contract to.

- Confirm the new contract policy was created. In the [Wire Hub](https://hub.wire.network) or [Explorer](https://hub.wire.network/explore), you should see:
   - **Account Type**: `Contract Account`
   - **Public Keys**: Matching the the public key you just saved.

### 4. Clone the Contract Repository

Clone the existing GitHub repository containing the `hello-world` contract to your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wire-Network/guides.git && cd guides/hello-world-contract
```

### 5. Import the private key(from your contract account)

Ensure your wallet is unlocked: 

```sh 
sudo clio wallet unlock --name=default --password "$(cat /path/to/wallet-password.txt)"
```

Then, import the key pair generated in [Step 2](#2-request-a-developer-contract-policy):

```sh
sudo clio wallet import --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```



### 5. Compile the Contract

Compile it using the `./build.sh`. This script uses the Wire Contract Development Toolkit (CDT) the `hello-world` contract into WebAssembly (WASM) format. The script will create a compilation folder `hello/` with the WASM and ABI files.

```bash
./build.sh
```

Upon successful compilation, you will see a `hello/` folder with `hello.abi` and `hello.wasm` files.

<!-- ![compiled-dir](/img/compiled-dir.png) -->

```sh title="hello-world-contract/"
|   ....
├── hello           
│   ├── hello.abi
│   └── hello.wasm
|   ...
```

### 6. Deploy the Contract

#### Edit the Deploy Script

- Open the deploy script (e.g., `deploy.sh`).
- Add -u parameter with the RPC of the testnet - `https://testnet-00.wire.foundation`
- Set the authority/permissions parameter (`-p`) to the contract account’s own username. The contracts deploys using its own authority (`-p <contractUsername>@active`).
- Set the parameter after `contract` subcommand to match the contract account's username as well.

:::info
Don't forget adding the `-u` to the deploy script. The video was recorded on a server already connected to the testnet locally, hence it was unintentionally ommited.
:::

```sh title="deploy.sh"
sudo clio -u https://testnet-00.wire.foundation set contract contractAccount ./hello -p contractAccount@active
```

See more information about `clio set contract` [here](/docs/api-reference/tooling/clio/command-reference/set/set-contract).

Run the deploy script:

```sh
sudo ./deploy.sh
```
If successful, you’ll see a transaction receipt indicating “executed success”.

- In the [Wire Hub](https://hub.wire.network) or [Explorer](https://hub.wire.network/explore), navigate to the *Accounts* -> *Contract Accounts* list. You should see your new contract.
- You can then inspect tables and actions under the *Contract* tab on the contract’s account page.

#### Testing the `hi()` Action from the Wire Hub

The Hello World contract includes a single action called `hi()`, which logs a greeting in the console.

- In the [Wire Hub](https://hub.wire.network), open the *Contract* Tab for your contract’s account.
- You’ll see *Actions* listed (in this case, just `hi`) and parameters field.
- To invoke the action, enter a username(e.g. `bob`) and click Submit.
- The Hub displays a receipt upon success, and you can view the console log output:

```txt
Hello, bob
```

- Copy the transaction ID to search the transaction and view the Transaction Detail page.


#### Testing the `hi` Action with `clio`

- Push an action with your personal Authority (Fails)

   Let's attempt to push an action with your personal authority (Fails)

   ```sh
   sudo clio -u https://testnet-00.wire.foundation push action <contractAccount> hi '["bob"]' -p <yourWireUsername>@active
   ```

   It will fail because you haven’t imported your personal account’s private key into your local clio wallet.

   ```sh 
   Error 3090003: Provided keys, permissions, and delays do not satisfy declared authorizations
   Ensure that you have the related private keys inside your wallet and your wallet is unlocked.
   Error Details:
   transaction declares authority '{"actor":"yourWireUsername","permission":"active"}', but does not have signatures for it.
   ```

- Push the Action with the Contract’s Authority (Succeeds)

   Run the command again, but use the contract policy account authority:

   ```sh
   sudo clio -u https://testnet-00.wire.foundation push action <contractAccount> hi '["bob"]' -p <contractAccount>@active
   ```

   Ouput:

   ```sh
   executed transaction: success
   Hello, bob
   ```

 - Requested a Developer Contract Policy
 - Built and Deployed a `hello-world` contract
 - Tested the contract actions via the Wire Hub and from the command line (clio)
