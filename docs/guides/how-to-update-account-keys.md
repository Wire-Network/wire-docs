title: Update Account Keys
---

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to update the keys associated with a Wire blockchain account using the `clio` CLI tool. You'll learn how to generate new key pairs, import them into your wallet, and update account permissions to use the new keys.

:::danger[Security Consideration]
Always ensure you have a secure backup of your current keys before updating them. If you lose access to both old and new keys, **you may permanently lose access to your account.**
:::

## Prerequisites

* Install the currently supported version of `clio.`
  
:::info[Note]
| The `clio` tool and `kiod` are bundled with the Wire software. [Installing Wire core](/docs/getting-started/install-dependencies.md) will install the `clio` and `kiod` command line tools.
:::

* You have access to a local Wire node.
* You have authority over the `sysio` account and access to the account's private key.
* You have created an account (e.g., `alice`) and imported its private key. For more information, see [how to create an account](/docs/guides/how-to-create-an-account.md).
* You are familiar with the basic `clio set account` commands. For reference, see [set account](/docs/api-reference/tooling/clio/command-reference/set/set-account.md).

:::warning[REMINDER]
The install process has already set up the wallet for the *root* user. To interact with clio, ensure **you are on the root user**. Run `sudo su -` to switch to the root user before proceeding with the tutorial.
:::

## Steps

This tutorial uses the **alice** account as an example. Replace `alice` with your actual account name throughout the process.

### Step 1: Generate a New Key Pair

Create a new key pair for the permission you want to update. Using `--to-console` will output the private and public keys directly to the console.

```sh
clio create key --to-console
```

**Example Output:**

```sh
Private key: 5JvdXZ6TkKvpZxYvpF5TLvuyiFTzUUW4YF67u1MfD4F2vDv2ina
Public key: SYS6nVfXcwEqZTxrrJCYBcePP9tVpqaH8ReKkBJxv9MuUuiZ46a4N
```

:::important
Save both the private and public keys. You'll need the private key for wallet import and the public key for permission updates.
:::

### Step 2: Import the New Private Key

Import the newly generated private key into your wallet:

```sh
clio wallet import --private-key 5JvdXZ6TkKvpZxYvpF5TLvuyiFTzUUW4YF67u1MfD4F2vDv2ina
```

**Example Output:**

```sh
imported private key for: SYS6nVfXcwEqZTxrrJCYBcePP9tVpqaH8ReKkBJxv9MuUuiZ46a4N
```

### Step 3: Update Account Permission

Update the account permission to use the new public key:

```sh
clio set account permission alice active '{
  "threshold": 1,
  "keys": [
    {
      "key": "SYS6nVfXcwEqZTxrrJCYBcePP9tVpqaH8ReKkBJxv9MuUuiZ46a4N",
      "weight": 1
    }
  ],
  "accounts": [],
  "waits": []
}' -p alice@owner
```

**Arguments:**

* `alice`: The account name to update
* `active`: The permission level to update (can be `active`, `owner`, or custom permissions)
* `{ "threshold": 1, keys: [{key: "SYS6nVfXcwEqZTxrrJCYBcePP9tVpqaH8ReKkBJxv9MuUuiZ46a4N", weight: 1}], "accounts": [], "waits": []}` - authorization object with the **new** key
* `-p alice@owner`: The permission used to authorize the transaction (requires `owner` permission)

**Example Output:**

```sh
executed transaction: cc2226e7751db645acb74de93a82e7e34f6fdead0cd32078d875393b3da0d57e  160 bytes  322 us
#         sysio <= sysio::updateauth            {"account":"alice","permission":"active","parent":"owner","auth":{"threshold":1,"keys":[{"key":"SYS6...
warning: transaction executed locally, but may not be confirmed by the network yet         ] 
```

### Step 4: Verify the Update

Confirm that the account permission has been updated successfully:

```sh
clio get account alice
```

**Example Output:**

```sh
permissions: 
     owner     1:    1 SYS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV
        active     1:    1 SYS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV

```

## Additional Considerations

### Updating Owner Permission

To update the owner permission, follow the same process but use `owner` instead of `active`:

```sh
clio set account permission alice owner '{
  "threshold": 1,
  "keys": [
    {
      "key": "SYS6nVfXcwEqZTxrrJCYBcePP9tVpqaH8ReKkBJxv9MuUuiZ46a4N",
      "weight": 1
    }
  ],
  "accounts": [],
  "waits": []
}' -p alice@owner
```

:::danger[Critical Warning]
Updating the `owner` permission is irreversible and requires extreme caution. Ensure you have secure backups and understand the implications before proceeding.
:::

### Multi-Signature Permissions

For accounts with multi-signature permissions, you may need to update multiple keys or adjust threshold values. Use the `--help` flag with the `set account permission` command for advanced options.

## Troubleshooting

### `Irrelevant authority included updateauth action declares irrelevant authority`

Ensure you're using the correct permission level (usually `@owner` for key updates)

### `Error 3120003: Locked wallet`

Make sure your wallet is unlocked before importing keys.

### `Error 3010004: Invalid authority Ensure that your authority JSON is valid follows the following format!...`

```txt
Error 3010004: Invalid authority
Ensure that your authority JSON is valid follows the following format!
{
  "threshold":      <INTEGER [1-2^32): the threshold that must be met to satisfy this authority>,
  "keys": [         <keys must be alpha-numerically sorted by their string representations and unique>
    ...
    {
      "key":        <STRING: SYS.IO compatible Public Key>,
      "weight":     <INTEGER [1-2^16): a signature from this key contributes this to satisfying the threshold>
    }
    ...
  ],
  "accounts": [     <accounts must be alpha-numerically sorted by their permission (actor, then permission) and unique>
    ...
    {
      "permission": {
        "actor":      <STRING: account name of the delegated signer>,
        "permission": <STRING: permission level on the account that must be satisfied>,
      },
      "weight":     <INTEGER [1-2^16): satisfying the delegation contributes this to satisfying the threshold>
    }
    ...
  ],
  "waits": [        <waits must be sorted by wait_sec, largest first, and be unique>
    ...
    {
      "wait_sec":   <INTEGER [1-2^32): seconds of delay which qualifies as passing this wait>
      "weight":     <INTEGER [1-2^16): satisfying the delay contributes this to satisfying the threshold>
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

Ensure authorization object is valid and follows the format above.

:::caution[Recovery]
Always retain your old keys until youâ€™ve confirmed that the new keys function correctly. If any issues arise during the update, you can still revert to the previous keys and restore access.
