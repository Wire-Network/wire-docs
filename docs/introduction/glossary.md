## Account

An account is a unique identifier and a requirement to interact with a Wire blockchain. Unlike most other cryptocurrencies, transfers are sent to a human-readable account name rather than a public key, while keys attributed to the account are used to sign transactions.

## Account Name

An account name is a human-readable identifier that is stored on the blockchain. Standard account names can only contain the characters .abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz12345. a-z (lowercase), 1-5 and . (period), must start with a letter or a number; cannot start or end with period.
It can be 13 characters and one of them has to be a period.

The ability to choose a username is granted to users at the T4 tier who purchase a node.

## Account Name Bidding

For non-standard accounts, those under 12 characters, Wire based blockchains provide a system where blockchain users can bid on accounts by submitting the bids via an auction process. Only one account name with the highest bidding price can be auctioned off every 24 hours among all submitted account names, that is, the system considers a bidding to be successful only when the bidding price is the highest among all other account bidding prices submitted.

## Application Binary Interface

A JSON-based description on how to convert user actions between their JSON and binary representations. The ABI may also describe how to convert the database state to/from JSON. Once you have described your contract via an ABI this allows developers and users to interact with your contract seamlessly via JSON.

Abbreviation: ABI

## Authority

On the Wire platform, the authority relates a public key and the authorization factors for an account and an account permission. The authority is a data structure linking account permissions to keys, thresholds, weights, delegated account permissions, and time waits.
