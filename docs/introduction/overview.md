## Blockchain

A blockchain is a decentralized infrastructure that operates without a central controlling entity. In a blockchain, transactions are recorded in a distributed ledger, forming an immutable history that cannot be altered without consensus from the network participants. This ensures that any transaction or change in the blockchain history is traceable and can be audited.

The term Blockchain Trilemma refers to the challenges that a blockchain confronts when aiming to achieve a perfect blend of decentralization, security, and scalability at the same time. It represents a significant obstacle to widespread blockchain technology and cryptocurrency adoption since it is a technological conundrum in the blockchain space - developers and architects need to do trade-offs between these elements and improving one often comes at the cost of another. A balance is never achieved, and in many cases, one of these three critical elements is sacrificed to optimize the other two, countering the values of the technology itself. Despite this problem driving innovation as new solutions emerge that promise to effectively balance all three aspects without compromise, there is an obvious need for a holistic approach - one that is designed as truly trustless, decentralized and scalable network. Wire Network aims to meet this need and revolutionize the blockchain industry by embedding these principles as its core pillars. 

## About Wire Network

At the heart of Wire Network's development principles is the firm commitment to **zero trust model**, trustlessness extends to all aspects of the network - hardware and software layers. Similar to the foundation of Bitcoin, Wire Network is designed and built to be completely secure and decentralized, **without any elements that deviate from these core principles**. 

Our ground-breaking innovations have established a new standard for cross-chain comminications through the creation of UPAP, by building upon open source specification that deterministically translates a single key into various address formats. UPAP has enabled the development and implementation of Wire Name Service(WNS) smart contracts and ultimately making low cost and high speed cross-chain transactions a reality.
Wire’s system determines asset ownership through a consensus mechanism that aligns with the origin chain’s state, as *assets never actually leave their native or origin chain*. By extending its protocol to interact directly with other networks via WNS, Wire avoids the **costs and complexities** of acting as the ultimate authority over assets. All transactions are independently verifiable, and following up on our commitment to trustlessness in every layer, this design implements rulesets that allow anyone to challenge the consensus through challenge-response mechanisms.


The scalability of the network is also a major consideration, as Wire Network must always have a path to accommodate a growing user base; which itself leads to its promise to high transaction speeds and throughput. While other networks struggle with scalability and transaction speed, the platform is designed to achieve high transactions per second (TPS), addressing a critical limitation that's still hindering blockchain's ability to replace existing centralized platforms for decades. Wire Network tackles this problem by leveraging high-performance hardware at the node level. By setting standards for computational power and storage capacity, the network ensures each node can efficiently process a large volume of transactions and account for data growth without sacrificing performance and speed.
