## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use the `clio create account` command:

### Create a new account named `nick`

:::info
The example below assumes you have access to a **local chain** and you have authority over `sysio` key pair.
:::

The command below assumes there are _two key pairs_ generated for `nick`.

Key pairs can be generated by using [`clio create key`](../create/key.md).

:::warning[WARNING]
Before using the command below, ensure you're switched to the root user (run `sudo su -`) since the wallet is set up under root.
:::

```sh
clio create account sysio nick SYS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV SYS6b23j5Yzn8pC1A4UwRhDpu9t47kcyGMp8af1bKKN6sFVUpCVBW -p sysio@active
```

**Output:**

```sh
executed transaction: ce26710f7fcb73c290aba82810d0fb61a24097f85fc27ea52c25848c228b4254  200 bytes  271 us

# sysio <= sysio::newaccount            {"creator":"sysio","name":"nick","owner":{"threshold":1,"keys":[{"key":"SYS4toFS3YXEQCkuuw1aqDLrtHim

warning: transaction executed locally, but may not be confirmed by the network yet         ]
```
