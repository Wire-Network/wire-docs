:::info
The example below assumes you have access to a **local chain** and you have authority over `sysio` key pair.
:::

## Command

The command below assumes there are two key pairs generated for the new account `nick`.

Key pairs can be generated by using [`clio create key`](../create/key.md).

```sh
clio create account sysio nick SYS4toFS3YXEQCkuuw1aqDLrtHim86Gz9u3hBdcBw5KNPZcursVHq SYS7d9A3uLe6As66jzN8j44TXJUqJSK3bFjjEEqR4oTvNAB3iM9S
A -p sysio@active
```

## Output

```sh
executed transaction: ce26710f7fcb73c290aba82810d0fb61a24097f85fc27ea52c25848c228b4254  200 bytes  271 us
