# Contract Development Toolkit (CDT)

CDT is a toolchain for WebAssembly (Wasm) and a set of tools to facilitate contract writing for the Wire framework. In addition to being a general-purpose WebAssembly toolchain, Wire-specific optimizations are available to support building Wire smart contracts. This new toolchain is built around Clang 7, which means that CDT has most of the current optimizations and analyses from LLVM.
