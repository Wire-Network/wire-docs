#### Removing Wire Sysio and Wire CDT

##### Uninstall Wire Sysio

To uninstall it, run:

```sh
sudo apt remove wire-sysio
```

If uninstalling has failed or if didn't remove all core components, you can manually delete them with the following command:

```sh
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/clio \
/usr/local/bin/kiod \
/usr/local/bin/nodeop \
/usr/local/bin/sysio-blocklog \
/usr/local/bin/trace_api_util \
.local/share/sysio \
~/sysio-wallet
```

:::danger
The uninstall command above will also remove the **default wallet** installed with Wire Sysio. To keep any imported keys, make sure to back them up before proceeding with deletion.

### Troubleshooting

If you are missing certain dependencies and when trying to install the binaries you are getting an error similar to:

```bash
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
Note, selecting 'wire-sysio' instead of './wire-sysio-3.1.6_amd64.deb'
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 sysio : Depends: libssl1.1 but it is not installable
         Depends: libicu60 but it is not installable
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

- Try and resolve it by looking for exact dependencies at Index of /ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl

- Find the exact version of `libssl` , in this case `libssl1.1`

- Download it:

``` bash
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1\~18.04.amd64.deb
```

- Install the downloaded package:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.amd64.deb
```

Repeat the same for any other packages that appear in the error message.

```bash
wget http://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/i/icu/libicu60_60.2-3ubuntu3.1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libicu60_60.2-3ubuntu3.2_amd64.deb
```

After successfully installing all missing packages, attempt to install the binaries again.
